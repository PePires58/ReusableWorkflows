## Reusable Workflows

Welcome to the Pepires58 reusable workflows, in this repository you can find some workflows that can help you in your development proccess.

# NodeJs Workflows

- 1 - Nodejs build: in this workflow you can restore dependencies, test and zip the node_modules as artifacts to other proccess. You will need to download the artifacts in order to restore node_modules.

Check more informations and how to use in: [NodeJs build documentation](https://github.com/PePires58/ReusableWorkflows/blob/main/docs/nodejs/001_nodejs_build_doc.md)

- 2 - NodeJs deploy: in this workflow you can restore dependencies (store as artifact), unzip node_modules, build a SAM template and deploy your code with cloudformation.
